# iOS Developers Mexico

We meet the last Saturda of every month to talk about everything that its involved in Apple technologies.

### I want to give a talk ðŸ“–

The talks should be about everything related to Apple, Swift, Architecture, best practices, design patterns, testing, automation, software engineering, real world experiences and new things that Apple introduces every year. Any interesting story or topic is welcome. Our talk selection process is very simple, and consists of three steps:

1) Open an issue with the title of what you are going to talk about and assign it to yourself.
2) Describe what your technical talk is about in the comments of the issue.
3) Assign a label (Talk 40 minutes, Workshop 3 hours).

**Note:** Workshops will be offered separately from Meetup events.

### Voting for proposals
If you are interested in a technical talk of the proposals in the issues, vote using the "Pick your reaction" functionality in the comments of the issue and select a +1.


### Code of Conduct

Both events and communication between community members must adhere to the provisions of the [code of conduct](https://github.com/iosdevelopersmx/code-of-conduct).
